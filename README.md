Simple Keylogger 
Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file.

This a basic keylogger program created in python using pynput library and datetime library. Pynput library monitor keystrokes and save them to a log file. Make sure you have the pynput library installed. If not you can install it using "pip install pynput" command in your terminal. Datetime library is used to mention the specific date and time at which the key was pressed. After installing the library, run this code, after that every key you press will be recorded in a txt file that you have named in the code. Here it is "keylog_recorders.txt".

Note - It will also make a log of special keys if pressed like ctrl left or right, shift, tab, spacebar
